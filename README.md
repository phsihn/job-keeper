# job-keeper full stack application

# Goal: Providing user the ability to keep track of jobs that they have applied for. Displays a feed of jobs that user has applied to and the status of the jobs/notes/ etc...

## Currently implementing each feature. Right now everything is run locally.
## User can currently add jobs and update them. Looking to implement a delete feature right now.

## Technology used: MERN stack. M - MongoDB, E - Express.js, R - React.js, N - Node.js

### Work in progress. Mostly for learning purposes and to tackle a problem I had/have as I job search.
